"""ðŸŒŠ Memory map WAVE files into numpy arrays ðŸŒŠ

Manipulate huge WAVE or RAW files as numpy matrices - even if they are too
large to fit into memory.

Memory mapping is a technique where files on disk are directly mapped to
locations in memory and use the same logic as swap space does.

Samples from a WAVE or RAW audio file are directly memory mapped to entries in
a ``numpy`` array, letting you manipulate very large audio files as if they
all fit into memory at one time, and even directly change samples on disk.
