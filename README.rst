Samples from a WAVE or RAW audio file are directly memory mapped to entries in a
``numpy`` array, letting you manipulate very large audio files as if they all
fit into memory at one time, and even directly change samples on disk.

API
===

``wavemap.WaveMap(filename, mode='r', *args, **kwargs)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(`wavemap/__init__.py, 31-43 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/__init__.py#L31-L43>`_)

Memory a map WAVE file to a ``numpy`` array

Return an instance of ``ReadMap`` or ``WriteMap``, depending on
``mode``.

See the documentation of ``ReadMap`` or ``WriteMap`` for full signatures.

Class ``wavemap.RawMap``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(`wavemap/raw.py, 14-78 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/raw.py#L14-L78>`_)

"Memory map raw audio data from a disk file into a numpy matrix

Class ``wavemap.ReadMap``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(`wavemap/read.py, 17-135 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/read.py#L17-L135>`_)

Memory-map an existing WAVE file into a numpy vector or matrix

``wavemap.ReadMap.__new__()``
_____________________________

.. code-block:: python

  wavemap.ReadMap.__new__(
       cls,
       filename,
       mode='r',
       order=None,
       always_2d=False,
       allow_conversion=True,
       warn='<function warn: print to stderr>',
  )

(`wavemap/read.py, 20-135 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/read.py#L20-L135>`_)

Memory-map an existing WAVE file into a numpy matrix.

ARGUMENTS
  filename
    The name of the file being mapped

  mode
    The file is opened in this mode.
    Must be one of ``'r'``, ``'r+'`` and ``'c'``.

    In mode ``'r'``, the default, the file is opened read-only and
    the ``numpy.darray`` is immutable.

    In mode ``'r+'``, the file is opened read-write and changes to the
    ``numpy.darray`` are automatically applied to the file.

    In mode ``'c'``, "copy-on-write", the file is opened read-only, but
    the ``numpy.darray`` is *not* immutable: changes to the array are
    instead stored in memory.

  order
    Samples usually get laid out in into a ``numpy.darray`` with``
    shape=(N, C)`` where ``N`` is the number of audio frames, and ``C`` is
    the number of channels.

    This is called column major order, but this can be toggled by
    setting the ``order`` parameter to ``F`` for Fortan or row-major row.

    See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27266338/

  always_2d
    If ``False``, the default, mono WAVE files with only one channel
    get special treatment and are mapped to a one-dimensional vector
    with ``size=(N,)``.

    If ``True``, mono WAVE files are treated the same as any other file
    and are mapped to a two-dimensional matrix with ``size=(N, 1)``.

  allow_conversion
    Some types of WAVE files cannot be directedly memory-mapped because
    their datatype is not supported by numpy - the list includes
    24-bit PCM, 8-bit Âµ-Law, and 8-bit A-law.

    If ``allow_conversion`` is ``True``, the default, the result is
    converted to a numpy type.  If it is ``False``, then the result is
    not converted and returned as numpy array of raw bytes

  warn
    Programmers are sloppy so quite a lot of real-world WAVE files have
    recoverable errors in their format.  ``warn`` is the function used to
    report those recoverable errors.  By default, it's set to print to
    ``sys.stderr`` but setting it to ``None`` disables errors entirely, or
    you can pass your own callback in

Class ``wavemap.WriteMap``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(`wavemap/write.py, 10-121 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/write.py#L10-L121>`_)

"Memory-map a new wave file into a new numpy vector or matrix

``wavemap.WriteMap.__new__()``
______________________________

.. code-block:: python

  wavemap.WriteMap.__new__(
       cls,
       filename,
       dtype,
       shape,
       sample_rate,
       roffset=0,
       warn='<function warn: print to stderr>',
  )

(`wavemap/write.py, 13-101 <https://github.com/rec/wavemap/blob/master/wavemap/write.py#L13-L101>`_)

ARGUMENTS
  filename
    the name of the file being mapped

  mode
    The file is opened in this mode.  Must be one of ``{MODES}``.
    Default is ``'r'``.

  order
    Samples usually get laid out in into a ``numpy.darray`` with``
    shape=(N, C)`` where ``N`` is the number of audio frames, and ``C`` is
    the number of channels.

    This is called column major order, but this can be toggled by
    setting the ``order`` parameter to ``F`` for Fortan or row-major row.

    See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27266338/

  roffset
    How many bytes in the file after the WAV data

  always_2d
    If ``False``, the default, mono WAVE files with only one channel
    get special treatment and are mapped to a one-dimensional vector
    with ``size=(N,)``.

    If ``True``, mono WAVE files are treated the same as any other file
    and are mapped to a two-dimensional matrix with ``size=(N, 1)``.
