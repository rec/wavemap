Manipulate huge WAVE or RAW files as numpy matrices - even if they are too
large to fit into memory.

Memory mapping is a technique where files on disk are directly mapped to
locations in memory and use the same logic as swap space does.

Samples from a WAVE or RAW audio file are directly memory mapped to entries in
a ``numpy`` array, letting you manipulate very large audio files as if they
all fit into memory at one time, and even directly change samples on disk.

Typical usage:

.. code-block:: python

    import wavemap

    wm = wavemap('test.wav', 'r+')  # r+ means read/write
    # Now you have a numpy matrix that you can use like any other

    wm /= 2
    # Each sample in the file is scaled by half.

``wavemap()``

  wavemap(
       filename: str,
       mode: str='r',
       order: Union[str, NoneType]=None,
       always_2d: bool=False,
       dtype: Union[numpy.dtype, NoneType]=None,
       shape: Union[NoneType, int, tuple]=None,

    Memory map a WAVE file to a ``numpy`` array

    Return an instance of ``ReadMap`` or ``WriteMap``, depending on
    ``mode``.

ARGUMENTS
  filename
    The name of the file being mapped

  mode
    The file is opened in this mode.
    Must be one of ``'r'``, ``'r+'``, ``'c'``, ``'w+'``

    In mode ``'r'``, the default, the file is opened read-only and
    the ``numpy.darray`` is immutable.

    In mode ``'r+'``, the file is opened read-write and changes to the
    ``numpy.darray`` are automatically applied to the file.

    In mode ``'c'``, "copy-on-write", the file is opened read-only, but
    the ``numpy.darray`` is *not* immutable: changes to the array are
    instead stored in memory.

    In mode ``'w+'``, "write", the file is opened for write, and overwrites
    whatever else is there.

  order
    Samples usually get laid out in into a ``numpy.darray`` with``
    shape=(N, C)`` where ``N`` is the number of audio frames, and ``C`` is
    the number of channels.

    This is called column major order, but this can be toggled by
    setting the ``order`` parameter to ``F`` for Fortan or row-major row.

    See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27266338/

  always_2d
    If ``False``, the default, mono WAVE files with only one channel
    get special treatment and are mapped to a one-dimensional vector
    with ``size=(N,)``.

    If ``True``, mono WAVE files are treated the same as any other file
    and are mapped to a two-dimensional matrix with ``size=(N, 1)``.

  dtype
    The numpy datatype of the samples in the file.

  shape
    The shape of the resulting numpy.darray. Can be a tuple, or a positive
    integer, or ``None``.

  sample_rate
    The sample rate in Hz (cycles per second)

  roffset
    How many bytes in the file after the WAV data

  warn
    Programmers are sloppy so quite a lot of real-world WAVE files have
    recoverable errors in their format.  ``warn`` is the function used to
    report those recoverable errors.  By default, it's set to print to
    ``sys.stderr`` but setting it to ``None`` disables errors entirely, or
    you can pass your own callback in

  offset
    How many bytes in the file before the WAV data
